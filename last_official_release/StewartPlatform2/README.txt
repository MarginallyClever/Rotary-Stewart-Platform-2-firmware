Arm3 for Windows Help
============================

Last updated: 2015-01-22

OSX
---

Double click Arm3.jar.  If that doesn't work, try double clicking start.command

Windows 
-----
Double click start32.bat or start64.bat.
Depending on what kind of computer you have one or the other should work.

If the software won't run it's probably because the batch file can't find java.exe.
Either you don't have java installed or your java installation is corrupt because
the bat file can't find the registry key for

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Javasoft\Java Runtime Environment\CurrentVersion

Most of the time this can be solved by reinstalling Java.
If that doesn't work, please use our forums for more help.
