Introduction
	tools you will need
	  	- soldering iron
	  	- Arduino software
	  	- small Phillips screwdriver
	  	- crazy glue
	  	- masking tape
      - pliers
	open and inspect your kit
		1.jpg
	  	compare with the BOM to make sure everything arrived in working order.
  		We have checked contents before shipping.
      
---------------------------
Glueing
	the frame

	the top

	the biceps
		12-19.jpg
		This is the hardest part!  Make sure the pieces line up correctly.
		Once the glue has dried an M3x15 goes in the hole at the square end and is held in place with an M3 nut.
    
---------------------------
The switches
	soldering
		<picture missing>
		red is the pin closest to the roller.
		black is the center pin.
		blue is the pin closest to the clicker.
	test
		<picture of soldering>
		connect the RUMBA controller to your computer with the USB cable provided.
		<picture of RUMBA input pins>
		connect the switch to an input.
		install test_switches.ino
		open the serial window and set the baud rate to 57600.
		press the switch.  A column should change from 1 to 0.
		disconnect USB.
	install
		thread the wire for two switches through the hole in each face.  secure the switches with zip ties so that the roller is downward.
			<picture>
			Switches 1 and 2 should be side-by-side.
			Switches 3 and 4 should be side-by-side.
			Switches 5 and 6 should be side-by-side.
	test 2
		connect the RUMBA controller to your computer with the USB cable provided.
		the switches again to be sure they are in the correct order.
		disconnect USB.
    
---------------------------
The stepper motors
	attach
		<picture of wiring for stepper 0>
		the wires order from left to right should be red, green, blue, yellow.
		connect the 5.1x2.2 female power supply to the RUMBA
	test one
		connect the 12v2a power supply to the RUMBA.
		install test_steppers_rumba.ino.  Motors will begin to move as soon as sketch uploads.
		open the serial window to see what the code is doing.
		when the test works, remove the stepper from the Arduino.
		disconnect 12v power and USB.
	install
		<picture of tape with writing>
		put a piece of tape on each stepper and at the far end of the wire.
		write the stepper number on the appropriate tape.
		<picture of steppers installed>
		install the steppers in a clockwise order.
			Steppers 1 and 2 should be side-by-side.
			Stepper 1 should be above switch 1.
			Stepper 2 should be above switch 2.
			Repeat for steppers 3-6.
		put the wires through the hole in the center of the frame.
		attach the steppers in order with M3x5 screws.
			The tape will make it easy to keep them organized.
	test 
		Make sure 12v power is not connected.
		put a small piece of tape on each motor shaft so you can easily see it move.
		install firmware_rumba_minimal.ino
		open the serial window.
			G00 X100; should turn stepper 1.
			G00 Y100; should turn stepper 2 *in the opposite direction*.
			G00 Z100; should turn stepper 3 same direction as #1.
			G00 U100; should turn stepper 4 same direction as #2.
			G00 V100; should turn stepper 5 same direction as #1.
			G00 W100; should turn stepper 6 same direction as #2.
      
---------------------------
The arms
  assemble the forearms: One ball joint goes on the end of each threaded rod.
    There should be ~140mm of visible rod between the two ball joints.
    The distance from center hole to center hole should be 167.5mm.
    The holes on the rods should be aligned.
    Use a small pair of pliers to press the metal ball into the plastic frame.
	attach the biceps to the forearms
		<picture of biceps and forearms>
	attach the forearms to the top
		<picture of forearms and top>
		make sure the arms are attached on the correct side. 
	attach the biceps to the motor shafts
		20-22.jpg
		use the spacer to make sure the biceps are at the correct distance from the frame.
		make sure the biceps are facing the correct direction.
		make sure the biceps touch the limit switches.
    
---------------------------
The stewart platform
	Make sure 12v power is not connected.
	install firmware_rumba_minimal.ino
	open the serial window.
	Connect 12v power.
  
---------------------------
Final tests
	M18; disables power to all stepper motors.
		You can freely move the platform.  Don't forget gravity is in effect!
	M17; enables power to all stepper motors.
		Try manually holding the platform at a strange angle and enabling power.
	Test short movements on each stepper motor.
		M18;
		move the platform so each bicep is approximately level.
		M17;
		Be prepared to disconnect 12v power if something goes wrong.
		G00 F200 Z1; should slowly move the platform up one centimeter.
	test homing
		G28;
		Steppers should immediately move "down" to touch switches and then move to home position.
		Because of the previous F200 they will move slowly.
	test full speed
		G00 F800; changes speed without moving.
		G00 X1.5; should move 15mm sideways.
		G00 Y1.5; should move 15mm orthogonal to X and Z.
		G00 U10; tilt 10 degrees around Y.
		G00 V-8.25; tilt 8.25 degrees around X.
		G00 W5; twist 5 degrees around Z.
		G00 X0 Y0 Z0 U0 V0 W0; will move back to center, flat.
		
Congratulations!  Your platform is assembled and appears to be working.
