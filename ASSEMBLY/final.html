<h2>Final tests</h2>
  <p>install firmware_rumba.ino</p>

  <h3>M18;</h3>
    <p>disables power to all stepper motors.</p>
    <p>You can freely move the platform.  Don't forget gravity is in effect!</p>
  <h3>M17;</h3>
    <p>enables power to all stepper motors.</p>
    <p>Try manually holding the platform at a strange angle and enabling power.</p>
  <h3>Test short movements on each stepper motor.</h3>
    <p>M18;</p>
    <p>move the platform so each bicep is approximately level.</p>
    <p>M17;</p>
    <p>Be prepared to disconnect 12v power if something goes wrong.</p>
    <p>G00 F50 Z1; should move the platform up one centimeter.</p>
  <h3>test homing</h3>
    <p>G28;
    <p>Steppers should immediately move "down" to touch switches and then move to home position.</p>
    <p>Because of the previous F50 they will move more slowly now.  G28 obeys the feed rate.</p>
  <h3>test full speed</h3>
    <p>G00 F200; changes speed without moving.</p>
    <p>G00 X1.5; should move 15mm sideways.</p>
    <p>G00 Y1.5; should move 15mm orthogonal to X and Z.</p>
    <p>G00 U10; tilt 10 degrees around Y.</p>
    <p>G00 V-8.25; tilt 8.25 degrees around X.</p>
    <p>G00 W5; twist 5 degrees around Z.</p>
    <p>G00 X0 Y0 Z0 U0 V0 W0; will move back to center, flat.</p>

<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
  <p>Your platform is assembled and appears to be working.</p>
  <p>Please send us a picture of your completed device and feedback about your experience.</p>
