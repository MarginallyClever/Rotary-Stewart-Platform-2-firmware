<h2>The stepper motors</h2>
	<h3>attach</h3>
		<picture of wiring for stepper 0>
		the wires order from left to right should be red, green, blue, yellow.
		connect the 5.1x2.2 female power supply to the RUMBA
	<h3>power supply</h3>
		<img src='26.JPG' width='900'>
		move the jumper on the RMBA from "Stand alone" to "USB power".
	<h3>test one</h3>
		connect the 12v2a power supply to the RUMBA.
		install test_steppers_rumba.ino.  Motors will begin to move as soon as sketch uploads.
		open the serial window to see what the code is doing.
		when the test works, remove the stepper from the Arduino.
		disconnect 12v power and USB.
	<h3>install</h3>
		<picture of tape with writing>
		put a piece of tape on each stepper and at the far end of the wire.
		write the stepper number on the appropriate tape.
		<picture of steppers installed>
		install the steppers in a clockwise order.
			Steppers 1 and 2 should be side-by-side.
			Stepper 1 should be above switch 1.
			Stepper 2 should be above switch 2.
			Repeat for steppers 3-6.
		put the wires through the hole in the center of the frame.
		attach the steppers in order with M3x5 screws.
			The tape will make it easy to keep them organized.
	<h3>test </h3>
		Make sure 12v power is not connected.
		put a small piece of tape on each motor shaft so you can easily see it move.
		install firmware_rumba_minimal.ino
		open the serial window.
			G00 X100; should turn stepper 1.
			G00 Y100; should turn stepper 2 *in the opposite direction*.
			G00 Z100; should turn stepper 3 same direction as #1.
			G00 U100; should turn stepper 4 same direction as #2.
			G00 V100; should turn stepper 5 same direction as #1.
			G00 W100; should turn stepper 6 same direction as #2.
