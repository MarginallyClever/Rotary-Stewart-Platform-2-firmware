<h2>The stepper motors</h2>
	<h3>Attach &amp; test one motor</h3>
    <img src='29.JPG' width='900' alt='wire colors'>
    <p>The wires order from left to right should be red, green, blue, yellow.  In this picture I have not connected motors 1 and 2.</p>
    <img src='30.JPG' width='900' alt='extensions'>
    <p>If you are using the motor extension cables provided with the kit then the word "MOTOR" on the connector should face the Polulu chip.</p>
    <img src='32.JPG' width='900' alt='heat shrink'>
    <p>Don't forget to put the heat shrink on first!</p>

    <p>Helping hands can make this work much easier.</p>
    <img src='28.JPG' width='900' alt='heat shrink shrunk'>
    <p>If you are using the motor extension cables provided with the kit then solder the extension blue, red, green, and black to the stepper motor red, green, blue, and yellow, respectively.</p>
    <img src='31.JPG' width='900' alt='MAIN-PWR'>
    <p>Connect the 5.1x2.2 female power supply to the RUMBA screw terminals labelled MAIN-PWR</p>
		<p>Connect the 12v2a power supply to the RUMBA.</p>
		<p>Install test_steppers_rumba.ino.  Motors will begin to move as soon as sketch uploads.</p>
		<p>Open the serial window to see what the code is doing.</p>
		<p>When the test works, disconnect the stepper from the RUMBA.</p>
		<p>Close the serial window, disconnect 12v power, and disconnect USB.</p>
	<h3>Install</h3>
		<picture of tape with writing>
		<p>put a piece of tape on each stepper and at the far end of the wire.</p>
		<p>write the stepper number on the appropriate tape.</p>
		<picture of steppers installed>
		<p>install the steppers in a clockwise order.</p>
    <p>Steppers 1 and 2 should be side-by-side.</p>
    <p>Stepper 1 should be above switch 1.</p>
    <p>Stepper 2 should be above switch 2.</p>
    <p>Repeat for steppers 3-6.</p>
		<p>put the wires through the hole in the center of the frame.</p>
		<p>attach the steppers in order with M3x5 screws.</p>
		<p>The tape will make it easy to keep them organized.</p>
	<h3>Test</h3>
		<p>Make sure 12v power is not connected.</p>
		<p>put a small piece of tape on each motor shaft so you can easily see it move.</p>
		<p>connect the 12v2a power supply to the RUMBA.</p>
		<p>install firmware_rumba_minimal.ino</p>
    <p>open the serial window and set the baud rate to 57600.</p>
    <p>G00 X100; should turn stepper 1.</p>
    <p>G00 Y100; should turn stepper 2 *in the opposite direction*.</p>
    <p>G00 Z100; should turn stepper 3 same direction as #1.</p>
    <p>G00 U100; should turn stepper 4 same direction as #2.</p>
    <p>G00 V100; should turn stepper 5 same direction as #1.</p>
    <p>G00 W100; should turn stepper 6 same direction as #2.</p>
    <p>G28; will spin every motor until the matching limit switch is hit.  Test all six.</p>
