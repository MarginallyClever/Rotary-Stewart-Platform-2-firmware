##Note

The initial commit is a gcode interpreter that will move motors according to bresenham's line algorithm.
higher-order logic for forward and inverse kinematics is still needed.

Assembly order:
- glue together wooden parts
- solder wires to limit switches
- test limit switches
- install limit switches and test again
- install steppers to frame
- test stepper movement without biceps
- install arms
- test short movements
- test G28
- final calibration
